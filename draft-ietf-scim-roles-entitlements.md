--- abstract

The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol schema, defined in RFC {{RFC7643}} defines the complex core schema attributes "roles" and "entitlements". For both of these concepts, frequently only a predetermined set of values are accepted by a SCIM service provider. The values that are accepted may vary per customer or tenant based on customizable configuration in the service provider's application or based on other criteria such as what services have been purchased or resources associated with entitlements. This document defines an extension to the SCIM 2.0 standard to allow SCIM service providers to represent available data pertaining to SCIM resources, roles and entitlements so that SCIM clients can consume this information and provide easier management of SCIM resources, role and entitlement assignments.

# Introduction

The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol's schema RFC {{RFC7643}} defines the complex core schema attributes "roles" and "entitlements". For both of these concepts, frequently only a predetermined set of values are accepted by a SCIM service provider. Available roles and entitlements may change based on a variety of factors, such as what features are enabled or what customizations have been made in a specific instance of a multi-tenant application. Moreover roles and entitlements may be associated with specific SCIM resources within the SCIM server. The core SCIM 2.0 RFC documents ({{RFC7642}}, {{RFC7643}} and {{RFC7644}}) do not provide a method for retrieving the available roles or entitlements and the resources associated with roles or entitlements as part of the SCIM 2.0 standard.

In order to allow for SCIM clients to reduce predictable errors when interacting with SCIM service providers, this document aims to provide a method for SCIM service providers to provide data on what roles and/or entitlements are available, the association between roles and/or entitlements and specific resources so that SCIM clients can consume this data to more efficiently manage resources between directories.

### Consuming Roles and Entitlements with SCIM Clients

When a SCIM service provider publishes role and entitlement definitions, SCIM clients can consume them efficiently. The process generally follows these steps:

1. Check Provider Support: Check the [ServiceProviderConfig Extension](#serviceproviderconfig-extension) for support for roles and entitlements and the resources associated with roles or entitlements.
2. Discover ResourceTypes: Query the /ResourceTypes endpoint to discover which standard and custom role and entitlement [resource types](#resource-type-representation) are supported.
3. Discover schemas for ResourceTypes: Fetch the corresponding [schemas](#schema-samples) from the /Schemas endpoint, matching them with the ResourceType URNs.
4. Consume [resource-specific endpoints](#sample-roles-and-entitlements-resource-endpoints) to retrieve the actual supported values for these defined resource types.

# Roles and Entitlements

The Roles and Entitlements SCIM Extension consists of two new resource types, `/Roles` and `/Entitlements`, as well as accompanying `ServiceProviderConfig` details to advertise support for this extension. In addition to the new resource types, service providers can use schema extensions to publish custom entitlements.


## ServiceProviderConfig Extension

SCIM endpoints that have implemented one or both of the endpoints from this extension MUST advertise which elements are implemented in the [ServiceProviderConfig](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643#section-5) endpoint as defined:

    RolesAndEntitlements

        configuration options. REQUIRED.

                attribute on the User resource. OPTIONAL.



## Role Resource Schema

The `/Role` resource type has a schema consisting of most of the attributes defined for the User resource's complex attribute "roles" in {{RFC7643}}, as well as an additional "supported" attribute so that SCIM service providers can indicate if the role is currently enabled and intended for use in their service. The following singular attributes are defined:

    id
      A unique identifier for the role as defined by the service
      provider.  If present, each representation of the resource MUST include a
      non-empty "id" value. It MUST be a stable, non-reassignable
      identifier that does not change when the same resource is
      returned in subsequent requests.  The value of the "id" attribute
      is always issued by the service provider and MUST NOT be specified
      by the client. This attribute is OPTIONAL.

    value
        The value of a role. REQUIRED.

    display
        A human-readable name, primarily used for display purposes.
        OPTIONAL.

    type
        A label indicating the role's function.  OPTIONAL
    supported
        A boolean type that indicates if the role is supported and usable
        in the SCIM service provider's system.  REQUIRED.

    limitedAssignmentsPermitted
        A boolean type that indicates if a limited number of users may
        be assigned this role. A value of false should be interpreted
        as no numerical restriction on the number of users that may
        hold this role. Other restrictions may exist.  OPTIONAL.

    totalAssignmentsPermitted
        An integer type that indicates how many users may be
        assigned this role, either directly or inherited.
        OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED if assignments are restricted
        to a certain number.

    totalAssignmentsUsed
        An integer type that indicates how many users are currently
         assigned this role, either directly or inherited.
         OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED if assignments are restricted
         to a certain number.

Additionally, the following multi-valued attributes are defined:

    containedBy
        A list of "parent" roles that contain a superset of
        permissions including those granted by this role.
        OPTIONAL.

    contains
        A list of "child" roles that this role grants the rights of.
        OPTIONAL.

## Entitlement Resource Schema

The `/Entitlement` resource type has a schema consisting of most of the attributes defined for the User resource's complex attribute "entitlements" in {{RFC7643}}, as well as an additional "supported" attribute so that SCIM service providers can indicate if the entitlement is currently enabled and intended for use in their service.

The following singular attributes are defined:

    id
        A unique identifier for the entitlement as defined by the service
        provider.  If present, each representation of the resource MUST include a
        non-empty "id" value. It MUST be a stable, non-reassignable
        identifier that does not change when the same resource is
        returned in subsequent requests.  The value of the "id" attribute
        is always issued by the service provider and MUST NOT be specified
        by the client. This attribute is OPTIONAL.

    value
        The value of an entitlement. REQUIRED.

    display
        A human-readable name, primarily used for display purposes.
        OPTIONAL.

    type
        A label indicating the entitlement's function. OPTIONAL.

    supported
        A boolean type that indicates if the entitlement is enabled
        and usable in the SCIM service provider's system. OPTIONAL.

    limitedAssignmentsPermitted
        A boolean type that indicates if a limited number of users may
        be assigned this entitlement. A value of false should be
        interpreted as no numerical restriction on the number of users
        that may hold this entitlement. Other restrictions may exist.
        RECOMMENDED.

    totalAssignmentsPermitted
        An integer type that indicates how many users may be assigned
        this entitlement, either directly or inherited.  OPTIONAL, but
        RECOMMENDED if limitedAssignmentsPermitted is true.

    totalAssignmentsUsed
        An integer type that indicates how many users are currently
        assigned this entitlement, either directly or inherited.
        OPTIONAL, but RECOMMENDED if limitedAssignmentsPermitted is true.

Additionally, the following multi-valued attributes are defined:

    containedBy
        A list of "parent" entitlements that contain a superset of
        permissions including those granted by this entitlement.
        OPTIONAL.

    contains
        A list of "child" entitlements that this entitlement grants
        the rights of.  OPTIONAL.
